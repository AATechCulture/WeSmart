## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 
How can we dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline by addressing inequitable education systems and improving literacy levels in Arkansas through AI-driven solutions?

* Tackling the school-to-prison pipeline in Arkansas.
* Addressing inequitable education systems and improving literacy levels.
* Using AI-driven solutions to promote equitable access and enhance learning outcomes.*

## Project Description 
WeSmart is an AI-driven personalized learning platform aimed at mitigating educational disparities in Arkansas, starting with the Little Rock School District.

How It Works:
* Leverages OpenAI API and educational APIs for adaptive learning.
* Provides gamified and personalized resources to engage K-12 students.
* Features a future mentorship system and social-emotional learning (SEL) modules for holistic student development.

## Project Value 
Target Audience:
* Primary: K-12 students, teachers, and mentors in Arkansas.
* Secondary: School administrators and policymakers.

Benefits:
* For Students: Engaging and culturally relevant educational experiences tailored to their needs.
* For Teachers/Mentors: Real-time tracking and actionable insights for personalized intervention.
* The long-term goal is to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by enhancing literacy and addressing socio-emotional needs, which has far-reaching impacts across all sectors. For example, improving education reduces crime rates, leading to safer communities; it creates a more skilled and employable workforce, boosting economic growth; and it lowers incarceration rates, reducing the burden on the justice system. Furthermore, addressing socio-emotional challenges fosters healthier individuals who can contribute positively to society, from better family dynamics to increased civic engagement.
